# notes on deployment

- depth camera notes (Go2 doesn't have one):
    - may need a realsense LiDAR to have depth 
    - maybe use a cv program that estimates depth from RGB data
    - investigate using existing L1 lidar pointcloud to generate depth image
    - check cv library to maybe use a fusion of lidar and rgb to get depth image
